## Instructions

This is a very basic shiny app that allows you to visualize the differences between a normal distribution and an exponential distribution (adapted from the RStudio shiny tutorial).

Just click on the corresponding radio button below and use the slider to choose the number of observations.

Observations following the selected distribution will be generated and plotted in the histogram from the right. You can also see a summary and a table with the generated numbers by clicking on the tabs above the figure.
