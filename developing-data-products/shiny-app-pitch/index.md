## Slide 1: Aim of the presentation

1. Introduce the Shiny App developed in the course
2. Explaining how to run it

--- .class #id 

## Slide 2: Shiny App

1. Aim: to show the differences between the normal an exponential distribution
2. How? By plotting histograms of both distributions
3. The shiny app is available online here: https://plopezgarcia.shinyapps.io/shiny-app/

## Slide 3: Normal distribution histogram


```
## stat_bin: binwidth defaulted to range/30. Use 'binwidth = x' to adjust this.
```

## Slide 4: Exponential distribution histogram


```
## stat_bin: binwidth defaulted to range/30. Use 'binwidth = x' to adjust this.
